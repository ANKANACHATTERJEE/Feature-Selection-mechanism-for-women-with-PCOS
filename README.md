# Feature-Selection-mechanism-for-women-with-PCOS
A machine learning model based on the features of women having PCOS. The data for it has been obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos?select=PCOS_data_without_infertility.xlsx)

From the results, it is seen that selection of features using correlation gives the maximum accuracy of 91%. Therefore, this is the best feature selection mechanism for the given dataset.
 However, improvements can be made by changing the parameters such as threshold value for all the feature selection algorithms as well.
